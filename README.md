TypeChef
========

Fork of the [TypeChef](https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef) project containing customisations required for [Hercules](https://github.com/joliebig/Hercules) and [Morpheus](https://github.com/joliebig/Morpheus). 
TypeChef is a research project with the goal of analyzing 
ifdef variability in C code with the goal of finding
variability-induced bugs in large-scale real-world systems,
such as the Linux kernel with several thousand 
features (or configuration options).
